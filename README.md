Code and circuits for Python and mechatronics learning

Hoping to use python for dummies to learn to do some basic coding. 
Have a bambulab A1 and am interested in making hobby projects like:
  [automated IR scarecrow]
  [autofilling, powerful watergun]
  [auto-tracking watergun turret]
  [smart home trinkets; lightswitches, white noise, motorized gate for driveway]
